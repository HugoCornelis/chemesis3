Different numerical solution methods are required to solve the
different types of mathematical equations associated with different
scales of modeling.  The cable equation and ion currents are
numerically solved with implicit Crank-Nicolson integration.  In G-3
this method of solution is implemented in a dedicated compartmental
solver called Heccer.  In the G-3 shell the user has to create a
mapping from the name of the neuron model to the solver.  For a single
neuron model with name "/traub94" the correct syntax is:

genesis > solverset "/traub94 => heccer"


Biochemical pathways in neuronal modeling are complex networks of
interacting ion concentration pools.  The G-3 implementation for
simulation of biochemical pathways is called Chemesis-3 and has a
dedicated optimized implementation to represent networks parameterized
with biochemical pathways.  To simulate a complex network model of
biochemical pathways, in this example called "/cal1", a user would
typically type from the G-3 shell:

genesis > solverset "/cal1 => chemesis3"


In the case the network of biochemical pathways is defined inside the
single neuron model, a user would have to type two commands with
wildcards that associate the correct solver with each component of the
model, for example:

genesis > solverset "/**/cal1 => chemesis3"
genesis > solverset "/traub94/**[!cal1] => heccer"


In later version of G-3 these rules will be builtin but still allow
the user to select a different method of solution for different
components of his model.
