Currently implemented chemesis3 objects:


rxnpool: a concentration pool that interacts with reactions and
diffuses to other pools.

Maps to NDF token POOL


conservepool: mass conservation based pool, computes the difference
between the total of all molecules (a model parameter, rest state),
and diffused molecules, divided by compartment volume.

Maps to NDF token POOL, with a different parameterization.


reaction: standard forward / backward chemical reactions between pools
of molecules.

Maps to NDF token REACTION


diffusion: Computes flux in molecules between two pools

Maps to NDF *segment parameter* diffusion_constant.  The appearance of
this parameter in an NDF file requires running the model using a
chemesis-3 solver.


The cal1.ndf and cal2.ndf files in the model-container library are
examples of chemesis-3 NDF files.

This makes 4 out of 12 objects that have been implemented.
