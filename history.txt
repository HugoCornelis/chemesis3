Only limited was available for the implementation of the chemesis-3
solver.  A time line reconstructed from the email conversations and
from the version control system:

- exploratory email conversations May 30th and following two weeks.

- initial preparations and start of implementation on June 13th.

- core implementation on Sunday June 26th, including a fully working
cal1 regression test case.  This was a day of crazy coding as in the
old days, total of 18 revisions with many enhancements.

- implementation of cal2 test case on June 29th and July 10th.

- initial scripting bindings were added starting at July 10th for perl
and July 13 for Python.

- first successful integration with the SSP scheduler on July 12th.

- model-container bindings started on July 13 and finished on July
17th.  Removes model-related functions such as compartment volume
computation that are already available in the model-container (and now
shared with other solvers).

- G-shell integration on July 17th and July 18th.
